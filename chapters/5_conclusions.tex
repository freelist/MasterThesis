\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusions}
In this work we have presented a large view about perception in industrial settings, especially focusing on robotic and machine vision. We analyzed state-of-the-art technologies, theories and their software and hardware implementations particularly looking at 3D object detection and localization and 3D scene reconstruction.

In this settings we have proposed novel benchmarking tools, such as the RAW Dataset, that wants to achieve higher levels of robustness, completeness and consistency in industrially oriented benchmarks, while maintaining at the same time high levels of complexity in order to be as much as possible reliable with complex and accurate software algorithms and tools used nowadays in industrial scenarios. The RAW Dataset is going to be published as one of the few complete and powerful test bed for the industrial community.

Nevertheless, this is still an on going work and many other plans are near to be accomplished before actually achieve the level of completeness needed in such strict and controlled settings. As part of the FlexSight project, the RAW Dataset will be used as first test bed solution for the largely introduced FlexSight Sensor, and given the nature of the project, the RAW Dataset will be augmented for supporting also test cases for other industrial applications, such as deformable object detection and localization.
