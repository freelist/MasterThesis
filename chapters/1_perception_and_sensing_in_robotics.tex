\chapter{Perception and Sensing in Robotics: Sensors and Algorithms}\label{ch:perceptionandsensing}
In this chapter we will talk about perception in industrial settings, focusing the attention on the tools, e.g. sensors and software, and the techniques used to solve industrial problems such as Random Bin Picking (RBP) and Pick\&Place (PPT) of objects. In the end we will focus also on the state of the art software libraries that nowadays are commonly used and tested in the industrial settings.

\section{Robotics in Industry}\label{sec:roboticsinindustry}
Over the years, industry has been one of the most active sector where robots and automated systems spread and diffused without limits. This is basically due to the fact that robots can easily complete tasks that humans are not capable at all, both for physical and technical failings. Robots are capable of compute the same operation multiple times without loosing any kind of accuracy and precision, they are repetitive, fast, and very well suited for industrial application, where most of the time being fast and accurate are two central points of the productive chain.

Manufacturing is one of the industrial sectors that saw the robotics ``era'' growing faster than elsewhere. Into the factories, robots are involved in every ring of the productive chain, from heavy loads handling to precise and accurate placing, from iron and metal soldering to small part assembly. The higher accuracy and velocity that robots can reach, with so high levels of repeatability and precision, brought robots, manipulators particular, at the top level of the industrial necessities.

The importance of robots in the industrial sector is supported also by big companies, such as Amazon, Google and others, that in the last years demonstrated high interests in investing and developing their technologies in order to improve also their performance and business.

\section{State of the art Software Libraries in Industry}\label{sec:industrylibraries}
Machine Vision is one of the most active area in industrial settings. Over the past years, many software companies and Open Source communities have dedicated lot of effort in developing robust and effective techniques and algorithms in order to assist industrial realities, such as companies and start ups, in performing computer vision assisted tasks, e.g. random bin picking, Pick\&Place tasks and so on.

In the following subsection a list of tools and libraries will be introduced, focusing mainly on the MVTec's Halcon Libraries, which are the one that we used in the experiment phase of this work. 

\subsection{Halcon Libraries}\label{subsec:halconlibs}
Halcon\footnote{http://www.mvtec.com/products/halcon/}, from MVTec, is a set of commercial software developed and sold explicitly for industrial settings. Over the past 5 years it has become the state of the art in machine vision for industrial tasks. It serves all industries with an extensive library of more than 1600 operators for blob analysis, morphology, matching, measuring, identification, and 3D vision, to name just a few.

The full library can be accessed from common programming languages like C, C++, C\#, Visual Basic .NET, and Delphi. In particular, our tests have been developed using the C++ APIs. In the following chapters we will test this standard Machine Vision approaches over the RAW and T-Less datasets, and compare them with completely different approaches such as Deep Learning CNNs for object localization and recognition.

The Halcon Library has also an interactive and friendly GUI, provided in order to facilitate the interfacing with the low level software APIs. The aforementioned software tool is called HDevelop, and an example of its usage and graphical interface is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:hdevelop_example}.

As anticipated, this software library is under commercial license, and our distribution has been sold to La Sapienza University of Rome that can use it for research and other non-commercial purposes.

\subsection{Matrox Imaging Library (MIL)}\label{subsec:mil}
Another important software library that needs to be mentioned is the Matrox Imaging Library\footnote{https://www.matrox.com/imaging/en/products/software/mil/} (MIL). MIL is a complete collection of software tools for developing machine vision in lots of different scenarios, it is not restricted to the industrial one such as for the previously mentioned Halcon Libraries, but it covers also medical images applications and many others.

MIL includes also a graphic user interface for fast developing and prototyping of solutions. An example of this GUI is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:mil_example}.

This library is not part of the tests and examples performed during this work.
